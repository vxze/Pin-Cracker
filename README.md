# roblox-pin-cracker
Helps you recover your pin if you have lost it (takes time)

# features
- uses most common pins first
- grabs likely pins automatically (birthday, last 4 characters of password, etc.)
- takes time to go through pins due to roblox rate limits

# requirements
- python installed (I use version 3.7.0). make sure to add to path when installing
- requests module. go to command prompt and type `pip install requests`

# example
